// How do I use the Minimax Algorithm in my game to pick the game piece placement for the opponent? (shaken game piece placement.)




// from WWDC 2016 Session 404 Developer Tools from the third instructor at minute 44:50 on the video / This may help you keep track of the players turns in the game.
// it starts off using a super classes and sub classes
// you may want to delv deeper and use protocols and structs

// How do I define the board?
